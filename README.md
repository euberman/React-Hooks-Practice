**Desc**

Just me playing around with hooks.

**Hook rules (Joshua Miles)**

Rules of Hooks:

1.  Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component
2.  You cannot conditionally invoke hooks
3.  Hooks always start with `use`

useState

Returns an array of 2 elements

* Your state
* A function you can use to change state

**Interesting Read on Hooks and Redux**
