**Desc**

Just me playing around with hooks. Hooks pretty much allows you to have store state and change state in a functional component. Thus replacing class components in react. Check out the blog below to see an in-depth break down of the two.

**Hook rules (Joshua Miles)**

Rules of Hooks:

1.  Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a functional component
2.  You cannot conditionally invoke hooks
3.  Hooks always start with `use`

useState
useEffect...

**useState Returns an array of 2 elements**
* Your state
* A function you can use to change state

To use hooks you can just import them from React there is no additional installations required. (See the DogList.js file)
